# CD8_HP
## T cell identity is established during thymic development, but how it is maintained in the
periphery remains unknown. Here we show that ablating Tcf1 and Lef1 transcription factors in
mature CD8+ T cells aberrantly induces genes from non-T cell lineages. The integrative mechanisms utilized by Tcf1/Lef1 underlie activation of T cell
identity genes and repression of non-T lineage genes, conferring fine control of various T cell
functionalities. These findings suggest that Tcf1/Lef1 control global genome organization and
help form intricate chromatin-interacting hubs to facilitate promoter-enhancer/silencer contact,
hence providing constant supervision of CD8+ T cell identity and function.
